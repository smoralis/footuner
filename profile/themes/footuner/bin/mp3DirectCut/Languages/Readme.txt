  mp3DirectCut multilanguage support


  PLEASE NOTE

  The original language of the software, of its license and of
  the documentation is english. The author of mp3DirectCut is
  not liable for correctness or completeness of the language
  files provided. The license is valid regardless of the
  applied language.
  
  The language files must be in the subfolder "Languages" of
  the mp3DirectCut directory. Alternatively you can directly
  put just the file of your language into the program directory.

  Older language files should work well with newer program
  versions, but some items will be in english of course.
